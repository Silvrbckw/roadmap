# IETF Tools Roadmap

:sparkle: View the [IETF Tools Roadmap Board](https://github.com/orgs/ietf-tools/projects/9)

This repository is used to communicate the IETF Tools Team roadmap. 

It is designed to drive conversation about what the roadmap _should be_, but
the issues and discussions section of this repository are not where that
conversation should take place. Contribution directly to this repository is intentionally restricted. (Compare this to [GitHub's public roadmap repository](https://github.com/github/roadmap)).

Discussion of changes to the roadmap should take place at
tools-discuss@ietf.org.

Issues with individual tools should be reported to their [respective repositories](https://github.com/ietf-tools/).
